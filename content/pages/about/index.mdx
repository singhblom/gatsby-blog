Hello!

I'm Martin Singh-Blom, a machine learning researcher at Embark Studios. I currently work on physics based animation and reinforcement learning but am interested in all things machine learning related and how it relates to game making. I tend to like pragmatics stuff that I can stuff into games right now, and really enjoy collaborating closely with tech art and game design to figure out how to make the ML actually get used and not just be of academic interest.
